    <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;font-size:5mm">HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to
        design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
        Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag
        which defines the structure of web pages. This language
        is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text
        accordingly. Most of markup (e.g. HTML) languages are
        human readable. Language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
