        simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to
        apply styles to web pages. More importantly,
        CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. CSS is easy to learn and
        understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
